<h1>Student Volunteers</h1>
          
            <p>
            Student volunteers are an important part of the
            SIGCSE Symposium and have been for many years.  Each volunteer works for up to 6 hours, 
            helping with various conference management
            activities.  You'll interact with the conference organizers
            and presenters and will meet other students from all over the
            world.  More information about the experience, the benefits,
            and how to sign up are provided below.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            To volunteer you should register to attend the SIGCSE symposium (the registration options are detailed on our <a href="/sigcse2010//attendees/registration.php">SIGCSE 2010 registration page</a>)
            AND you should <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=D_2b6QKGXqUwSZFhm_2fBMd_2fCg_3d_3d">sign up to be a student volunteer</a>.
            </p>

            NOTE:  We regret that applications from prospective student volunteers are
            no longer being accepted.
            </strong> 
            We appreciate your interest, and invite you to attend
            the conference as a regular student attendee.  The registration
            fees are very affordable:  $30 for SIGCSE members, or $40 for
            non-members.  And, we hope that you will consider
            volunteering for a future SIGCSE symposium (such as SIGCSE
            2010 in Milwaukee, WI!).

<h2>What do I have to do to become a student volunteer?</h2>
</div></div>  
            <p>
            Each student volunteer is asked to sign up as a volunteer
            prior to the conference.  (Instructions for signing up as
            a student volunteer are given below.)  
            Upon arrival at the conference site, you must check in at the Registration Desk to receive your conference registration packet then visit the Student Volunteer Office to pick up your work schedule (with a list of times, locations, and duties).
            </p>

<div class="SectionHeader"><div class="Full">
<h2>Who is eligible to be a student volunteer?</h2>
</div></div> 
            <p>
            Any full time student may become a student volunteer.
            Both undergraduate and graduate students are welcome.
            You specify your school affiliation when you sign up as
            a volunteer, and you should bring a copy of your current
            course schedule to the conference as verification of your
            full time status.  Students attending the conference for
            the Research Poster competition <!-- or the Doctoral Consortium -->
            are welcome to become volunteers as well.
            </p>

<div class="SectionHeader"><div class="Full">
<h2>What kinds of work will I do as a student volunteer?</h2>
</div></div> 
            <p>
            It varies. You might work at the registration booth to help
            organize the packets that we give out to attendees.
            You might be at the door of the exhibits hall to verify that
            the people entering have a conference badge.
            You might count the participants at various sessions.
            You might hang out at certain sessions to assist the speakers
            with handouts or equipment.
            </p>

<div class="SectionHeader"><div class="Full">
<h2>Do I have a say in what work I do as a student volunteer?</h2>
</div></div> 
            <p>
            Not much, but we'll do what we can.  There are often fewer
            volunteers than we have jobs, so we have to prioritize.
            </p>

<div class="SectionHeader"><div class="Full">
<h2>When during the conference will I do my student volunteer work?</h2>
</div></div> 
            <p>
            This issue is driven by conference needs.
            Some time periods are busier than others.
            We'll take your preferences into account whenever possible.
            When you sign up as a student volunteer, you'll specify
            when you plan to arrive and leave the conference.
            Within those constraints, we'll make some initial plans.
            We realize that things may come up and will try to make
            dynamic changes as needed.
            In return, we ask that you be as flexible as possible.
            Your duties may be broken into separate time periods and even across separate days.  We guarantee no more than 6 hours of assigned work per volunteer but target an average of 5 hours.
            </p>

<div class="SectionHeader"><div class="Full">
<h2>Do I have to be there for the whole conference to be a student volunteer?</h2>
</div></div> 
          <p>
            No. We realize that travel plans and other commitments exist.
            We hope that students local to the Chattanooga area will be
            flexible.  In particular, there is always a need
            for volunteers on Tuesday and Wednesday, which is before most
            of the conference activities begin and before many
            of the traveling student volunteers have arrived.
            We encourage local student volunteers to be available on Tuesday and Wednesday.
            </p>

<div class="SectionHeader"><div class="Full">
<h2>Can I get funding for travel or hotel expenses?</h2>
</div></div> 
            <p>
            The conference itself does not provide funding for student
            volunteers, but you may be able to get some support
            through your department or through another source at your
            university.  You should print your registration
            acknowledgment to show to potential funding sources.
            </p>

            (the registration options are detailed on our
            <a href="/sigcse2010//attendees/registration.php">SIGCSE 2010 registration page</a>)

            You must sign up to be a student volunteer prior to the
            conference itself (we cannot accept walk-in student volunteer
            applications at the conference).
            On completion of your work as a student volunteer,
            you will receive a refund of your conference registration fee.

            <p>
            NOTE:  If conference registration is not yet open,
            you can still sign up to be a student volunteer.
            We will send you a reminder when conference registration opens
            so that you can complete the registration process.

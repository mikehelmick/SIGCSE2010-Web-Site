<h1>SIGCSE 2010 Accommodations</h1>

<p>To help conference attendees begin their travel planning, we are happy to provide the following information about the hotels which will have blocks of rooms available at special conference rates. And, as SIGCSE has done in the past, we have a roommate matching website to help pair you with a roommate to reduce the cost of attending the symposium.</p>

<h2>Roommate Matching</h2>
</div></div>
<p>We recognize that many SIGCSE attendees work at schools with very limited -- even nonexistent! -- travel budgets.  To help you reduce your cost to participate in the symposium, we are happy to once again provide assistance with roommate matching: <a href="http://www.cs.rit.edu/sigcse/">The SIGCSE 2010 Roommate Database</a>. Once registered, you can input your preferences and see other registrants who have compatible preferences.  The rest is up to you!</p>

<p>The roommate database is hosted by the <a href="http://www.cs.rit.edu/">Rochester Institute of Technology Department of Computer Science</a> and is administered by <a href="http://www.cs.rit.edu/~ptt/">Paul Tymann</a>. Please <a href="mailto:ptt@cs.rit.edu">contact Paul</a> with any questions that you may have about this service.</p>

<h1>Embedded Xinu, Workshop #10</h1>
      
<p>To better support hands-on activities with Embedded Xinu, Workshop #10 will be held offsite at Marquette University.  Marquette and the workshop organizers are arranging round-trip shuttle transportation for attendees from the Midwest Airlines Center (the symposium's main venue).</p>

<p>Shuttles will depart from the Wells Street exit of the Midwest Airlines Center, just north of Ballroom 104AB on your program map.</p>

<p>Because another group's event will be in progress along that hallway, we ask that you proceed directly to the exit when the shuttle pickup time arrives.  There is an area between the two sets of doors where passengers can wait if the shuttle is delayed.</p>

<p>Details on timing of the shuttle will be available here soon!</p>
